# Snakes and Ladders - Shruti Sekhar

## Why Snakes and ladders?

I played it as a child. It seemed like a game that was buildable after two weeks of learning to code. It is my first project as part of the Web Development course for Ironhack Bootcamp

## About the game

Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian game that was known as 'Moksha Pattam'. It was used to teach children the idea of vices and virtues and their consequences in a persons life.

## Features

- Lots of snakes
- A game board that took a bit of math to build

## What could be next

- Numbering the game board
- Getting the players to move from tile to tile
- Getting the players to slide down the snake or up the ladder
